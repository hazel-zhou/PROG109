	<h1> Hazel's Final Project - Part 2</h1>
	<h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>
	<p>I had never learned about HTML/CSS/Javascript in my life before taking this course. In a funny way to say it would be, "I know every word in the HTML source code but when they combine together, it makes no sense to me." Hence, I expect that this class will be challenging to me.</p>
	<h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h2>
	<p>I used the template that we created for the Module 04 assignment.</p>
	<h2>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h2>
	<p>The most challenging part of my portfolio is writing the CSS. I absolutely have no talent in art design at all. Sometimes it's difficult to accommodate the contents with the style using the same CSS template. But given the fact that I am really bad at user interface design, I try my best to fit my web contents to the pre-designed style template.</p>
	<h2>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</h2>
	<p>This most impressive part of this course was the meeting with Ella Mae. Before taking this class, I never thought of the idea of usability and accessibility. I just think of the style that I prefer without considering the universal of the web. Taking this class changed my view on Web design. First of all, we develop a web and we have our target audiences. If the audiences have difficulties in obtaining information from your web, then the design of your web is not good. Spreading information is one of the most basic purposes of building a website.</p>
	<h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
	<p>I would recommend them to leverage the online tutorials and materials as much as possible. We are all standing and learning on the shoulder of the giants. They have created brilliant works that we can all learn from. My second recommendation would be, "don't be afraid of asking questions, either go to your professor or the TA". I am pretty regret that I didn't do it very often when I was taking this class, so I would recommend future students taking this class to ask questions as much as possible.</p>
